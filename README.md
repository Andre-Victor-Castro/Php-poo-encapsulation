# Encapsulation
**Overview**: Safeguards an object's internal data by restricting access to its properties—only allowing modifications through predefined methods.

**Key Aspects**:
- Implements access modifiers (private, protected, public) to control visibility of attributes/methods
- Ensures state changes occur predictably and securely

**Advanced Concepts**:
- Proper use of getters/setters
- Adhering to Tell, Don’t Ask (favor behavior exposure over data exposure)
- Immutable objects and design best practices
